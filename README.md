A Knime workflow to parse full-text HTML outputs from Factiva.
By Angus Veitch, March 2019.

This is a Knime workflow that converts HTML outputs saved from Factiva (a subscription-based news database) into a tabular format so that it can be passed to text analysis software.

You will need to install Knime first to run this workflow. You (or more likely your institution) will also need access to Factiva to obtain the kind of data that this workflow accepts.

I accept no responsibility whatsoever for what you do with this workflow, especially if it happens to violate Factiva's terms of service.

I also can't guarantee that the workflow will actually do what it is supposed to, since it will break as soon as Factiva changes the format of their HTML outputs. All I can say for sure is that it was working effectively with outputs obtained from Factiva in late February 2019. If and when it does break, I cannot guarantee that I will fix it.

I wrote a blogpost about this workflow at http://seenanotherway.com/facteaser/. It contains jokes.
